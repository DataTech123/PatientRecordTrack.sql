The purpose of designing a patient record tracking database is to help track patient visits at relevant locations. By combining patient visit data from two locations through internal networking operational systems, we can gain comprehensive insights into patient activities.

First, write an SQL statement using INNER JOIN to select the optional visit location. Second, use SELF JOIN or LEFT JOIN operators to find missing and hidden data in query.

Write T-SQL to input a parameter to pass the optional patient's name as a value to validate data for stored procedures in the database.

The project includes database syntax (programming language), which is only a partial representation of my coding skill set. I can develop a complex database structure in coordination with the database management and IT teams from your organization.

Thank you for your review and any questions for further development.
